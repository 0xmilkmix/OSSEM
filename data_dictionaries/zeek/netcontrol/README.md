# Zeek Network Control Event Logs
Zeek can connect with network devices like, for example, switches or soft- and hardware firewalls using the NetControl framework. The NetControl framework provides a flexible, unified interface for active response and hides the complexity of heterogeneous network equipment behind a simple task-oriented API, which is easily usable via Zeek scripts.
