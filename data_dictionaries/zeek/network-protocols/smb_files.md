# SMB Files Log

These events can be coorelated with Zeek kerberos event, and Zeek smb_mapping event using the event_uid (uid) field. Additionally, this can be coorelated using Windows event 5145 and other file share events.

For the `share_name` field on a Windows 5145 event, the value would look like `\\*\SYSVOL` using the example value `\\dc001.adtest.local\SysVol` from below taken from a real logging enviornment for both.
