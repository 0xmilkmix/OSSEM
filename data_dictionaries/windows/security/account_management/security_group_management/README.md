# Audit Security Group Management

Audit Security Group Management determines whether the operating system generates audit events when specific security group management tasks are performed

This subcategory allows you to audit events generated by changes to security groups such as the following:

* Security group is created, changed, or deleted.
* Member is added or removed from a security group.
* Group type is changed.
