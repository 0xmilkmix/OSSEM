# Event ID 4649: A replay attack was detected

## Description

This event generates on domain controllers when KRB_AP_ERR_REPEAT Kerberos response was sent to the client.

Domain controllers cache information from recently received tickets. If the server name, client name, time, and microsecond fields from the Authenticator match recently seen entries in the cache, it will return KRB_AP_ERR_REPEAT. You can read more about this in [RFC-1510](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1510.txt). One potential cause for this is a misconfigured network device between the client and server that could send the same packet(s) repeatedly.
