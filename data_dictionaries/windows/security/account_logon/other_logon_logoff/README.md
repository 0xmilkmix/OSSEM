# Audit Other Logon/Logoff Events

These other logon or logoff events include:

* A Remote Desktop session connects or disconnects.
* A workstation is locked or unlocked.
* A screen saver is invoked or dismissed.
* A replay attack is detected. This event indicates that a Kerberos request was received twice with identical information. This condition could also be caused by network misconfiguration.
* A user is granted access to a wireless network. It can be either a user account or the computer account.
* A user is granted access to a wired 802.1x network. It can be either a user account or the computer account.

Logon events are essential to understanding user activity and detecting potential attacks.
