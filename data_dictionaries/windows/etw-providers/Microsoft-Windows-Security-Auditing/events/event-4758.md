# Event ID 4758: A security-enabled universal group was deleted

## Description
Event 4758 is the same as 4734, but it is generated for a universal security group instead of a local security group. All event fields, XML, and recommendations are the same. The type of group is the only difference.
Event 4758(S) generates only for domain groups, so the Local sections in event 4734 do not apply.
