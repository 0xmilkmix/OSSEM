# Event ID 4614: A notification package has been loaded by the Security Account Manager.

## Description
This event generates every time a Notification Package has been loaded by the Security Account Manager.
In reality, starting with Windows Vista, a notification package should be interpreted as afs Password Filter.
Password Filters are DLLs that are loaded or called when passwords are set or changed.
Each time a system starts, it loads the notification package DLLs from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Notification Packages registry value and performs the initialization sequence for every package.
