## Data Dictionary

|Standard Name|Field Name|Type|Description|Sample Value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|TBD|AwsAccountId|string|The AWS account ID where a finding is generated.|`111111111111`|
|TBD|Compliance|object|Exclusive to findings that are generated as the result of a check run against a specific rule in a supported standard (for example, CIS AWS Foundations). Contains standards-related finding details.|`{"Status": "PASSED","RelatedRequirements": ["Req1", "Req2"]}`|
|TBD|Confidence|integer|A finding's confidence. Confidence is defined as the likelihood that a finding accurately identifies the behavior or issue that it was intended to identify.Confidence is scored on a 0–100 basis using a ratio scale, where 0 means zero-percent confidence and 100 means 100-percent confidence.However, a data exfiltration detection based on a statistical deviation of network traffic has a much lower confidence because an actual exfiltration hasn't been verified.|`42`|
|TBD|CreatedAt|datetime|An ISO8601-formatted timestamp (as defined in RFC-3339 Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps) that indicates when the potential security issue captured by a finding was created. Because the CreatedAt timestamp reflects the time when the finding record was created, it can differ from the FirstObservedAt timestamp, which reflects the time when the event or vulnerability was first observed.|`2017-03-22T13:22:13.933Z`|
|TBD|Criticality|integer|The level of importance that is assigned to the resources associated with the finding. A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criticality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical resources.  Criticality is scored on a 0–100 basis, using a ratio scale that supports only full integers. This means that you should assess not only which findings impact resources that are more critical than others but also how much more critical those resources are compared to other resources. A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criticality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical resources.|`99`|
|TBD|Description|string|A finding's description. This field can be nonspecific boilerplate text or details that are specific to the instance of the finding.|`The version of openssl found on instance i-abcd1234 is known to contain a vulnerability.`|
|TBD|FirstObservedAt|datetime|An ISO8601-formatted timestamp (as defined in RFC-3339 Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps) that indicates when the potential security issue captured by a finding was first observed.Because this timestamp reflects the time of when the event or vulnerability was first observed, it can differ from the CreatedAt timestamp, which reflects the time this finding record was created|`2017-03-22T13:22:13.933Z`|
|TBD|GeneratorId|string|The identifier for the solution-specific component (a discrete unit of logic) that generated a finding. In various solutions from security findings products, this generator can be called a rule, a check, a detector, a plug-in, and so on.|`acme-vuln-9ab348`|
|TBD|Id|string|The product-specific identifier for a finding.|`us-west-2/111111111111/98aebb2207407c87f51e89943f12b1ef`|
|TBD|LastObservedAt|datetime|An ISO8601-formatted timestamp (as defined in RFC-3339 Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps) that indicates when the potential security issue captured by a finding was most recently observed by the security findings product.Because this timestamp reflects the time of when the event or vulnerability was last or most recently observed, it can differ from the UpdatedAt timestamp, which reflects the time this finding record was last or most recently updated.|`2017-03-23T13:22:13.933Z`|

If you specify a classifier, you must also specify a category. <br> The '/' character is reserved and must not be used in a category or classifier. Escaping the '/' character is not supported.|`["Software and Configuration Checks/Vulnerabilities/CVE"]`|
|TBD|UpdatedAt|datetime|An ISO8601-formatted timestamp (as defined in RFC-3339 Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps) that indicates when the findings product last updated the finding record. Because this timestamp reflects the time when the finding record was last or most recently updated, it can differ from the LastObservedAt timestamp, which reflects when the event or vulnerability was last or most recently observed.When you update the finding record, you must update this timestamp to the current timestamp. Upon creation of a finding record, the CreatedAt and UpdatedAt timestamps must be the same timestamp. After an update to the finding record, the value of this field must be greater than all of the previous values that it contained.|`2017-03-23T13:22:13.933Z`|
|TBD|UserDefinedFields|string|A list of name/value string pairs that are associated with the finding. These are custom, user-defined fields that are added to a finding. These fields can be generated automatically via your specific configuration. Findings products must not use this field for data that the product generates. Instead, findings products can use the ProductFields field for data that doesn't map to any standard AWS Security Finding Format field.|`{"reviewedByCio": "true","comeBackToLater": "Check this again on Monday"}`|
|TBD|VerificationState|string|The veracity of a finding. Findings products can provide the value of UNKNOWN for this field. A findings product should provide this value if there is a meaningful analog in the findings product's system. This field is typically populated by a user determination or action after they have investigated a finding.<br>Valid values: <br> UNKNOWN – The default disposition of a security finding unless a user changes it. <br> TRUE_POSITIVE – A user sets this value if the security finding has been confirmed. <br> FALSE_POSITIVE – A user sets this value if the security finding has been determined to be a false alarm. <br> BENIGN_POSITIVE – A user sets this value as a special case of TRUE_POSITIVE where the finding doesn't pose any threat, is expected, or both|`TRUE_POSITIVE`|
|TBD|Workflow|string|Provides information about the status of the investigation into a finding.|`{"Status": "NEW"}`|
|TBD|WorkflowState (deprecated)|string|This field is being deprecated in favor of the Status field of the Workflow object.The workflow state of a finding. Findings products can provide the value of NEW for this field. A findings product can provide a value for this field if there is a meaningful analog in the findings product's system. <br> Valid values:. <br> NEW – This can be associated with findings in the Active record state. This is the default workflow state for any new finding. <br> ASSIGNED – This can be associated with findings in the Active record state. The finding has been acknowledged and given to someone to review or address. <br> IN_PROGRESS – This can be associated with findings in the Active record state. Team members are actively working on the finding. <br> RESOLVED – This can be associated with findings in the Archived record state. This differs from DEFERRED findings in that if the finding were to occur again (be updated by the native service) or any new finding matching this, the finding appears to customers as an active, new finding. <br> DEFERRED – This can be associated with findings in the Archived record state, and it means that any additional findings that match this finding aren't shown for a set amount of time or indefinitely.Either the customer doesn't consider the finding to be applicable, or it's a known issue that they don't want to include in the active dataset. <br> DUPLICATE – This can be associated with findings in the Archived record state. It means that the finding is a duplicate of another finding.|`NEW`|
