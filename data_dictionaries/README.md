# Data Dictionaries

This part of the OSSEM project contains specific information about several security event logs organized by operating system and their respective data sets. Each dictionary describes a single event log and its corresponding event field names. The difference between the [Common Information Model](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/OSSEM/blob/master/common_information_model) folder and the data dictionaries is that in the CIM the field definitions are more general whereas in a data dictionary, each field name definition is unique to the specific event log.

## Data Dictionaries Definitions

| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| [Windows](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/OSSEM/blob/master/data_dictionaries/windows) | [Windows Security](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/OSSEM/blob/master/data_dictionaries/windows/security) | The security log records each event as defined by the audit policies you set on each object. This includes auditing such as account logon, account management, detailed tracking, logon logoff, object access, policy change and system  |
