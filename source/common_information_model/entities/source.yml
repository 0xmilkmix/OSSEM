  event.
data_fields:
- standard_name: src_bytes
  type: integer
  description: network bytes sent by the src_ip_addr
  sample_value: '100'
- standard_name: src_domain
  type: string
  description: If there is a clear distinction of the domain VS hostname VS FQDN this
    is the domain field. More often than not this should NOT be used and should be
    defined in the ./target.md, ./host.md, or ./user.md. However, you may follow the
    recommendations additional-guidelines/domain_or_hostname_or_fqdn.md if there is
    a clear example for this
  sample_value: bigwheel.corporation.local
- standard_name: src_file_extension
  type: string
  description: The file extension of a file (.txt, .exe, etc)
  sample_value: exe
- standard_name: src_file_name
  type: string
  description: name of a file without its full path
  sample_value: a.exe
- standard_name: src_file_path
  type: string
  description: full path of a file including the name of the file
  sample_value: C:\users\wardog\z.exe
- standard_name: src_fqdn
  type: string
  description: If there is a clear distinction of the domain VS hostname VS FQDN this
    is the FQDN field. More often than not this should NOT be used and should be defined
    in the ./target.md, ./host.md, or ./user.md. However, you may follow the recommendations
    additional-guidelines/domain_or_hostname_or_fqdn.md if there is a clear example
    for this
  sample_value: bob-berto-pc.bigwheel.corporation.local
- standard_name: src_host_name
  type: string
  description: The Source server, host, hostname, domain, or domain name. Some examples,
    would include the TLS server name, HTTP Host, DNS Query Name, etc. For information
    on how to define and use this field refer to the documentation additional-guidelines/domain_or_hostname_or_fqdn.md
  sample_value: www.google.com
- standard_name: src_ip_addr
  type: ip
  description: Source IP address
  sample_value: 10.10.10.10
- standard_name: src_ip_bytes
  type: integer
  description: network IP (header) bytes sent by the src_ip_addr
  sample_value: '100'
- standard_name: src_is_ipv6
  type: boolean
  description: If src_ip_addr is IP version 6
  sample_value: 'false'
- standard_name: src_mac
  type: string
  description: Source MAC address
  sample_value: a9:68:82:28:c4:6d
- standard_name: src_mime_type
  type: string
  description: Source MIME type as seen in (layer 7) application layer details or
    as defined by an application scanner such as an anti-virus/EDR. For HTTP this

  sample_value: application/pdf
- standard_name: src_packets
  type: integer
  description: Network packets sent
  sample_value: '5'
- standard_name: src_port
  type: integer
  description: Source port number
  sample_value: '138'
- standard_name: src_port_name
  type: string
  description: Source port name. This is usually determined by IANA common port assignment.
    Therefore, this means its a guess and NOT the actual the application used
  sample_value: netbios-dgm
- standard_name: src_vlan_id
  type: integer
  description: The Source VLAN ID if it can be determined. Most commonly if from a
