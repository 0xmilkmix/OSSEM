title: Event Schema
description: Event fields used to define specific metadata of the event itself. For
  example event_uid or event_creation_timestamp
data_fields:
- standard_name: '@timestamp'
  type: date
  description: 'The most accurate timestamp of the log. Commonly this will be the
    original reporting timestamp from the log. However, if you believe the log timestamp
    has been altered or skewed (ie: either due to timezone issues or NTP skew)then
    replace this field with the most likely timestamp. Always keep the original log
    timestamp in the field event_creation_timestamp'
  sample_value: '43201.2404861111'
- standard_name: event_creation_time
  type: date
  description: original time when event/log was created as reported from the log source
    itself
  sample_value: '43201.2404861111'
- standard_name: event_duration
  type: float
  description: The length/duration of the event in seconds  (e.g., 1 min is 60.0)
  sample_value: '60'
- standard_name: event_error
  type: string
  description: Information about an error
  sample_value: '``'
- standard_name: event_error_code
  type: integer
  description: Integer that defines a particular event_error
  sample_value: '``'
- standard_name: event_id
  type: integer
  description: event identifier for specific event logs. Event ids might repeat across
    different data sources. This is most common in Windows using EventID
  sample_value: '4688'
- standard_name: event_original_message
  type: string
  description: The (original) log message from the source before any ETL manipulations/modifications
  sample_value: '``'
- standard_name: event_severity
  type: string
  description: The severity of the event as defined manually or usually via the original
    log, commonly this would be syslog severity. The number codes should be converted
    to their corresponding string value
  sample_value: alert
- standard_name: event_status
  type: string
  description: Defines the status of a particular event
  sample_value: User logon with expired account
- standard_name: event_status_code
  type: integer
  description: Integer that defines a particular event_status
  sample_value: '3221225875'
- standard_name: event_sub_status
  type: string
  description: Additional status information
  sample_value: Account expired 300 days ago
- standard_name: event_status_code
  type: integer
  description: Integer that defines a particular event_sub_status
  sample_value: '0'
- standard_name: event_type
  type: string
  description: A description of the event, which can help with categorization.
  sample_value: Login
- standard_name: event_type_detailed
  type: string
  description: Additional description of event_type if applicable
  sample_value: '``'
- standard_name: event_uid
  type: string
  description: Unique ID specific to the log/event as recorded from the source. For
    example in Windows event logs, use RecordNumber
