# X509 and Certificates Schema

Data about X509 and Certificates. These would commonly be found in TLS/SSL connections, smart card certificates, kerberos requests, code signing of PE's and executables, etc...

This document is a work in progress, but is a foundational start there is included. Specifically the main foundations of certificate information is already in here.
