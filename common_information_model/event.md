# Event Schema

Event fields used to define specific metadata of the event itself. For example `event_uid` or `event_original_time`

## Data Fields

| Standard Name | Type | Description | Sample Value |
|--------|---------|-------|-------|
| @timestamp             | date    | The most accurate timestamp of the log. Commonly this will be the original reporting timestamp from the log. However, if you believe the log timestamp has been altered or skewed (ie: either due to timezone issues or NTP skew)then replace this field with the most likely timestamp. Always keep the original log timestamp in the field `event_creation_time` | `43201.2404861111`                |
| event_duration         | float   | The length/duration of the event in seconds  (e.g., 1 min is 60.0)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `60`                              |
